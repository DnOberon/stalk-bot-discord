Stalk-bot allows you to share your island's turnip prices and invite others to visit at the same time.

Register your island by typing `!stalk-register dodo-code price`.
Each island is registered for a maximum of 30 minutes. During that time other users of the system will potentially have access to your island via your supplied Dodo code.

Ask for an island to visit by typing `!stalk-price`.
