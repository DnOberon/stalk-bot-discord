### Using Stalk-Bot
After adding Stalk-Bot use is easy. Type any of these commands while Stalk-Bot is in the same channel 

<br>

#### `!stalk-register`
Use this command to register your island with Stalk-Bot. The command expects two arguments - a Dodo Code and the current price of turnips on your island. e.g `!stalk-register DOG12 123`

Your island will be available within Stalk-Bot for 30 minutes after registration. Registering with the same code will reset your registration timer. There are no guarantees that anyone will see your island via Stalk-Bot.

<br>

#### `!stalk-price`
This command will return a Dodo Code and the price of turnips of the island to which the Dodo Code belongs. 

Act fast though, each time Stalk-Bot returns each island only a limited number of times. There are no guarantees that the returned island is open, the system relies on trust in players so please don't abuse it.

<br>

#### `!stalk-report`

This command expects a single argument, an island code e.g `!stalk-report DOG189`. This command allows you to report an island code that's not open, a foul name, or whose host is being unkind or behaving poorly.

#### `!stalk-help`
This command will display information on how to use Stalk-Bot
